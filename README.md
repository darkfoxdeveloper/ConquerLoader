## Components (DLLs) and Their Purpose

| DLL | When it is used | Purpose (confirmed) |
|-----|----------------|---------------------|
| **COFlashFixer.dll** | Only in **5717–6186** (when `UseDecryptedServerDat = true`) | Fixes **Flash-related issues** in old client versions. |
| **ConquerCipherHook.dll** | In **5717–6736** (when `UseDecryptedServerDat = true`) | Cipher-related hook to ensure the **password is correctly transmitted** during login (authentication compatibility). |
| **COHook.dll** | In **5717–6736** (when `UseDecryptedServerDat = true`) | Implements the logic to **read and use a custom `server.dat`** generated by the loader. Different builds exist depending on the client version. |
| **CLHook.dll** | In **< 5717** and **> 6736** (legacy mode) | Legacy hook used to change **server IP and server name**. Functionality is limited and incomplete in some client versions. |
| **TQAnp.dll** | Written to disk in DX8/DX9 environments (depending on version), alongside `COHook.dll` | Modified library used for **authentication/password bypass compatibility**. *(Not injected directly by this method; it is placed in the game directory to be loaded by the client or another component.)* |
